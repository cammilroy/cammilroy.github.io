    <h1>⚾ Data Over Instinct: How AI is Rewriting the Rules of Sports</h1>
    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Cameron Milroy <br>
    <strong>Course:</strong> History of Artificial Intelligence: Minds & Machines<br>

    <h2>🎯 What’s the Research Problem?</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are radically transforming professional sports—from how players are evaluated to how games are played. But what does this mean for fairness, strategy, and the human spirit of competition? This proposal explores how systems like MLB’s <strong>Statcast</strong> are shifting decision-making from coaches and scouts to algorithms and sensors.</p>

    <div class="quote">“A player’s value is no longer judged by a coach’s eye—but by spin rate, launch angle, and exit velocity.”</div>

    <h2>🔬 Sources & Methods</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary Sources:</strong> MLB’s Statcast documentation, Hawk-Eye system details, MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference talks</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary Sources:</strong> Peer-reviewed articles from Chmait & Westerbeek, Ghosh et al., Udelf’s critique on athlete stress from over-datafication</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💡 Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>This is about more than just sports. It’s about how AI is redefining what counts as knowledge and value—on the field and off. If we let AI decide what “greatness” is, what human qualities are we leaving behind?</p>

    <h2>🧠 Consequences of Inaction</h2>
    <p>If we don’t critically examine how these technologies are shaping performance metrics, we risk entrenching hidden biases, excluding unconventional talent, and damaging athlete well-being in the name of optimization.</p>
